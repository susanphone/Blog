_This is the first in my series of blog posts to share the results of my thesis, which can be found [here](/assets/thesis.pdf)_

Malware is a file or script that is distributed to disrupt the activities of its intended (sometimes unintended) recipients. In the world of malicious software, or malware for short, numerous methods of attack exist, even for the same types of malware. Therefore it's important to understand the differences between each type of malware and its attack vectors. Having this understanding will allow you to properly identify and counter these malicious programs.  


I collected the following data using a large database of malware metadata samples from the Software Engineering Lab at Montana State University. In my next blog post, I will talk about my findings and what they mean for the security posture of various popular bug bounty programs.
