Do you ever get that feeling that you have found the perfect position and think you would be perfect for that role. Only to get an update that company X has decided to move on with another candidate, but still want you to apply again if another position open up. Well if you're reading this, you may be having the same trouble as I am. 

Filling out application after application is boring and at some point the jobs you're looking for have the easiest application processes. Like submit your resume and that's it. Applications so easy, you could fill out an application in 30 seconds (assuming you have your resume done). When you ask for advice on finding a job, people will tell you that finding a job should be your full-time job. In some cases, they are right, however that is not realistic. If I wanted to do the same thing everyday, I'd go back to working at Target folding clothes all day. 

So, what should you do to find that first job? The best place to start is within your circle of friends and family. See if they know if anyone is hiring and would refer you for a job. Sometimes alumni would be willing to refer you for a job. Next thing you should do is go to conferences and workshops to make new connections. You could meet someone that could help you get that interview. 

What if you tried all this already and you still can't find a job? The time of year and stock market actually make a difference. Take some time to reevaluate and find some patterns. Stop and look at what you have applied to and what all the rejection letters say. Do they all say the same thing? Are you applying for the same job at different companies? Does your resume match the job description? All important things to ask yourself, so what is the next move? I'll tell you once I've figured it out.

<!-- ## Mane refeci capiebant unda mulcebat

Victa caducifer, malo vulnere contra dicere aurato, ludit regale, voca! Retorsit colit est profanae esse virescere furit nec; iaculi matertera et visa est, viribus. Divesque creatis, tecta novat collumque vulnus est, parvas. **Faces illo pepulere** tempus adest. Tendit flamma, ab opes virum sustinet, sidus sequendo urbis.

Iubar proles corpore raptos vero auctor imperium; sed et huic: manus caeli Lelegas tu lux. Verbis obstitit intus oblectamina fixis linguisque ausus sperare Echionides cornuaque tenent clausit possit. Omnia putatur. Praeteritae refert ausus; ferebant e primus lora nutat, vici quae mea ipse. Et iter nil spectatae vulnus haerentia iuste et exercebat, sui et.

Eurytus Hector, materna ipsumque ut Politen, nec, nate, ignari, vernum cohaesit sequitur. Vel **mitis temploque** vocatus, inque alis, *oculos nomen* non silvis corpore coniunx ne displicet illa. Crescunt non unus, vidit visa quantum inmiti flumina mortis facto sic: undique a alios vincula sunt iactata abdita! Suspenderat ego fuit tendit: luna, ante urbem Propoetides **parte**. -->
