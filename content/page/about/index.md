I'm a software engineer who loves finding vulnerabilities in software and maintaining security compliance. I just finished a masters in computer science. You can find my thesis [here](assets/ThesisOnBugBountyPlatforms.pdf) and my resume [here](assets/SusanMcCartneyResume.pdf).

In my free time, I like to read mystery novels, solve puzzles, bake/cook new recipes, and learn different hobbies with the supervision of my favorite dog, Lucy.
